Independently from the phonecalls a more generic vpn network could be tried.
Under this model perhaps it is possible to redirect the default gateway within a limit
of 3 hops. This means a transitive vpn network. Therefore within a network namespace there would be 2 default gateways.
One going into the tun0 and one coming out of the tun0.
So if Alice -> Bob and Bob -> John, then Alice (->) John .
Here -> means "connects to" or "is client of".
Here (->) means that John would receive the traffic from Alice and recognize that its coming from two hops away.
It could also be that : John -> Jane . Then Alice [->] Jane .
Here [->] means that Jane would receive the traffic of Alice passing over Bob then over John, and since its 3 hops away 
Jane would force it out on its connection to the internet.

Furthermore this could be randomized every half an hour, at every hop.
Ongoing tcp connections would be dropped and would need to restart.

A small gui is given...
